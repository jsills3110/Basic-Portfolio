                If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Zip. That easy. Working it up and down, back and forth.
            <p>
                When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. In your world you have total and absolute power. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.

                Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here.

                And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. And maybe, maybe, maybe... It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll make some happy little bushes here. You are only limited by your imagination.

                There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Use your imagination, let it go. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Let's have a nice tree right here.

                Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. A fan brush can be your best friend.

                That easy. And maybe a little bush lives there. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Play with the angles. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen.
